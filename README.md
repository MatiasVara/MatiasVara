I am Matias from Argentina and I live in France since 2011. I enjoy programming and designing software systems. My main project is [Toro](httt://www.torokernel.io) that I have started in 2003. This is a unikernel written in Freepascal. General speaking, I enjoy working on operating system development in which I have to write software that interacts with the hardware. Also, I like to try new things.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on development of [Toro](htttp://www.torokernel.io) unikernel
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to leverage on formal methods to improve software development
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Toro
- Some of my contributions
